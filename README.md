# Hippo
An iOS app that keeps track of what you do and when you do it.

You should be able to just sign the Xcode project with your own license and build to your phone/simulator.

I only have one user in the database so, admitedly, anyone else building and making changes will effect my user account. This will change in the future. 

The hippoServer holds a tiny little server you can run on a Raspberry Pi on the same network as your Amazon Dashes. You will have to configure the MAC addresses of the Dashes but once you do, you can have them set to update different items in the app.
